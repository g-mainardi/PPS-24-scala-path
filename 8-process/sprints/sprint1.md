### Sprint Goal
Start Date: 23/6
<br/>
End Date: 29/6

The aim of the sprint is first to set up the project repository, the build tool and the CI.
Then, we aim to design architecture and model so that everyone is on the same page.
Secondly, the sprint also aims to design a view and controller and a base planner that will be used as a common base.
Lastly, the sprints aims to build the core logic of different scenario generation.

### Sprint Review
We have successfully set up the project repository, the build tool and the CI.
We have done a lot of pair programming at start to design the model and the architecture, and then we have split the work in (i) controller, (ii) view, (iii) base planner.
After that we had a common base for the scenarios generation, and we have split the work in (i) maze, (ii) terrain, (iii) traps.
A basic working version of the controller and the view has been achieved, using a dummy scenario.
Also a first version of the scala-prolog integration with a dummy planner has been achieved.


### Sprint Retrospective
We have experienced pair programming, and we have found it very useful when starting a project. We know we are on the same page so far.
We were also able to better divide the work and responsibilities having a common base.
